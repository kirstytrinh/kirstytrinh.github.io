                The task was to create a prototype app that would support and improve the project museum of.... The name of the museum I chose is Museum of Monopoly. The app was created to be used before, during, and after visiting a museum. Purchasing museum admission with an app is the before stage. The scavenger hunt and shooting pictures take place during stage. The next step is to conduct a survey about the visit which is the after stage. As my museum is dedicated to Monopoly, I preserve the essential elements, such as the colours, house cards, and figurines, that make Monopoly so recognisable.
