                Since many people experience imposter syndrome unknowingly, it is the focus of my campaign. The purpose of my campaign is to raise awareness of imposter syndrome and to reassure those who are experiencing it that they are not alone. The billboards are situated in the city roads, streets and train station so that people can view them on their route to and from work because the intended audience is workers. My primary campaign is a motion advertisement that shows the cognitive process of a person with imposter syndrome when they are given a task by their management. The fact that the ball starts off large before gradually shrinking shows how exhausted and worn out the individual are. The last scene, shows the the ball become big but not as big as the first scene because they pretend that everything is fine.
