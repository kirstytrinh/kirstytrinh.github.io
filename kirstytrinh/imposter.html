                Since many people experience imposter syndrome unknowingly, it is the focus of my campaign. The purpose of my campaign is to raise awareness of imposter syndrome and to reassure those who are experiencing it that they are not alone. The billboards are situated in the city roads, streets and train station so that people can view them on their route to and from work because the intended audience is workers. My primary campaign is a motion advertisement that shows the cognitive process of a person with imposter syndrome when they are given a task by their management. The fact that the ball starts off large before gradually shrinking shows how exhausted and worn out the individual are. The last scene, shows the the ball become big but not as big as the first scene because they pretend that everything is fine.

                The first supporting product for my campaign is a landscape billboard motivational poster that, when people pass it while feeling down, will inspire them. The second supporting product is an interactive poster whiteboard that is situated near the elevators, where employees pass by it every day. There are two instructions on this interactive poster: “Place the sticker next to the emotion you are feeling” and “Write something motivational to brighten someone's day.” The board will be covered in stickers of various colours and inspirational phrases to create a lovely mural.
