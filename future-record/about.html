            My project focuses on Augmented Reality (AR). 
            Morton Heilig designed the Sensorama in 1957, which is a gadget that provides users with visual, auditory, and olfactory information. By incorporating three-dimensional objects, sounds, films, and graphics into our world, AR modifies our relationship prescriptions. AR can be classified into three types: marker-based, markerless-based, and location-based. My images are based on markerless AR that we see in our everyday lives. AR improves our daily lives by allowing us to be more efficient in our regular duties. The images I created depict what AR would appear like from both an adult and a child's perspective.
