                It was a nice sunny day and I went to Half Moon Bay which is a calm, gentle and shallow beach. As the name suggests, the little inlet is deeply curved into a half moon crescent shape and the surrounding Red Bluff cliffs make it a particularly sheltered beach for little kids. In the future we are able to see someone emotions on how they are feeling. My emotions at the beach were a rollercoaster; I arrived happy but as I walked in the heat, I became fatigued and overheated.
