                The task is to fix an individual's sleeping schedule by ensuring that they get the required 8
                hours of sleep. Everyone always gets distracted by their phone during the night. Therefore
                the product will lock the user out of your phone until the next morning. To do this they must
                set up the provided details. When the phone is locked, they won't be notified by their
                notifications and is required to enter their passcode 5 times to unlock it or just the phone the
                next morning. There is also a section where you can track the sleeping progress.

            <div class="more-pic"> 
                Your sleeping pattern is terrible, you would sleep and wake up at different times each day. You want to go to sleep early but you keep getting distracted by your phone. Therefore you are going to try minimising distractions and phone usage by using the app Hush. It will track and fix your sleep routine but you must set it up to your liking. Then you are able to press sleep and your phone will be locked. <br> <br>

            <div class="info-heading"> Prototype Refinement </div>
            <div class="more-pic"> 
                Before testing the prototype was very messy and didn't portray my task nicely. The setup steps were unnecessary so removed it and added a setting section where you can set up the requirements. I added the weather and a quote to make it more welcoming in the morning. I changed the questions into statements where it's telling the user to do something. <br><br>

            <div class="more-pic"> 
                Result: 15 people completed the test and it shows that my UI was clear and readable through the word counts. Hence I can improve by making the UI more aesthetically pleasing. <br> <br>

            <div class="info-heading"> 1st Click Test </div>
            <div class="more-pic"> 
                Result: 13 people completed this test. I asked the user where they will click if there were using the sleeping app. The majority of the user tap on the sleep button saying because it looks like a button or they want to sleep. This shows the user negative through the app easily. However, a few of the user tap in the circle because it is in the middle of the screen. Therefore, I can improve by making the UI more cohesive and demonstrate a clearer hierarchy <br> <br>
